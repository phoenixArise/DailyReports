Daily Report of March 22nd

Done:

- Toggle Switches for each categories

- Custom URL list view is complete and its logic is almost complete (I haven't figured out how to unbock the websites yet)

- Research on Unit Test (for extensions): Custom Shield UI doesn't need testing yet because we are tweaking the given class much. But Activity Monitor probably needs unit testing.

What I will work on:

- Study more on Unit Testing
- Unblocking websits
