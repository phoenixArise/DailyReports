Daily Report of March 22nd

Toggle Switches for each category
    - Complete
    Implemented Adult Filter. Now, the adult category toggle works.

    - Room for improvement
    1. Adult Filter can also have a custom list of websites on top of what's offered by Apple.
     
    Action for 1.
      Enabling the adult filter toggle shows a list of custom websites to block with options to show and hide the list (when enabled)
     
    2. Toggle UIs can look better with consistent colour for letters.
     
    Action for 2.
    

Custom URL list view
    - Complete
    Almost. It blocks most websites on the custom list.
     
    - Room for improvement
    1. Certain websites like Twitter and Reddit are not blocked.
   
    Action for 1.
      I have contacted Apple Support about it today. I'm waiting for feedback.
      Although it doesn't block from the custom list, it still blocks from Family Activity Selection.
 
Unit Test
  - Complete
    1. I have added a unit test for a function in the Model class
     
  - Room for improvement
    1. In the test target, I will look into automation testing methods to open safari, enter websites and check if they are restricted.
     
    Action for 1.
      Research on this topic is needed.
      It is my design choice at the moment to focus testing on the main App target (not extensions, at least for now)
