Daily Report of March 22nd

Toggle Switches for each categories
	- Complete	
        Implemented Adult Filter. Now, adult category toggle works properly.

	- Room for improvement
        1. Adult Filter can also have custom list of websites on top of what's offered by Apple.
        
        Action for 1.
            Enabling adult filter toggle shows a list of custom websites to block that sync with the toggle with option to show and hide the list optionally (when enabled)
        
        2. Toggle UIs can look better with consistent color for letters.
        
        Action for 2.
            To be done, tomorrow.

Custom URL list view 
	- Complete
        Almost. It blocks most popular websites such as google, netflix, safesurfer.io, and so on.
        
	- Room for improvement
        1. At the moment, there are cetain websites that are not blocked like Twitter and Reddit.
    
        Action for 1.
            I have contacted Apple about it today. I'm waiting for a feedback from them
            Although it doesn't block from the custom list, it still blocks from Family Activity Selection.
 
Unit Test
    - Complete
        1. I have added a unit test for a function in Model class
        
    - Room for improvment
        1. I think that in the test target, I will need to look into automation testing methods to open safari, enter websites and check if restricted properly or not.
        
        Action for 1.
            Research on this topic is needed.
            It is my design choice at the moment to focus testing on the main App target (not extensions, at least for now)
