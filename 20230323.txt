Daily Report of March 23rd

Toggle Switches for each category
  - Complete
    Adult Filter can also have a custom list of websites on top of what's offered by Apple.
    Toggle UIs can look better with consistent colour for letters.
  - Room to improve
    Still needs to finish the backend for the adult website blocklist

Custom URL list view
  - Complete
    I didn't find a solution yet after doing hours of research.
  - Suggestion
    "Allowed Websites" works flawlessly. Perhaps, we can gear toward that
 
MVVM
  - Currently, the project follows MVC. I will adapt MVVM tomorrow as we will get more views like AddANewWebsiteView .
   
Downtime
  - I still haven't found a way to choose all applications from Family Activity Selection programmatically. I will do a lot more research on this topic.
  - The best idea currently is to block all categories of apps.
   
Incentivising Encouraged Apps
  Plan of Attack (Two Track)
  - Traditional Approach (Monitor child's device usage)
  - After some research, I think it might be a good idea for a child to request rewards.
